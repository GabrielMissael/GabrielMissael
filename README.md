### Hi there!:sparkles:

I'm Missa, a Physics student from Mexico, interested in the intersection between physics, computation, and artificial intelligence, and with research experience in astrophysics and NLP. I'm devoted to sharing science and technology with others, contributing to open-source, and using all these to create a positive impact. Beyond that, I believe in the power of community 💖: working together with other people, collaborating, and sharing is what amplifies our chances of improving our world. Some insights about me:

- 🌌 I completed a [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) in astrophysics and was involved in some cosmology-related projects.
- 🤖 I'm learning about natural language processing, particularly about Transformers.
- 🚩 I'm a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://education.github.com/experts), and a volunteer at [Clubes de Ciencia México](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/).
- 💝 I'm a member of several technical and scientific communities, such as [Future Lab](https://futurelab.mx/), and [GOLF](https://www.facebook.com/golf.fisica).
- ✨ I'm a former Major League Hacking Fellow, Open Source track. I contributed to the Meta Research project [AEPSych](https://aepsych.org/).
- 💬 I'm looking to share with others by giving workshops or talks (about DS, Git/GitHub, NLP, etc.). Feel free to reach me; I'm happy to help!
