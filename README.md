### Hi there!:sparkles:

I'm Missa, studying physics at the Univerity of Guanajuato. I'm currently pursuing a career in Data Science, with a particular focus on NLP and DL. Beyond that, I believe in the power of community 💖: working together with other people, collaborating, and sharing is what amplifies our chances of improving our world. Some insights about me:

- 🌌 I did a [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) in astrophysics and was involved in some cosmology-related projects.
- 🤖 I'm learning about natural language processing, particularly about Transformers.
- 🚩 I'm a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://education.github.com/experts), and a volunteer at [Clubes de Ciencia México](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/).
- 💝 I'm a member of several technical and scientific communities, such as [Future Lab](https://futurelab.mx/), [GOLF](https://www.facebook.com/golf.fisica), and [GDSC UG](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-guanajuato/).
- 💬 I'm looking to share with others by giving workshops or talks (about DS, Git/GitHub, NLP, etc.). Feel free to reach me; I'm happy to help!
